# Initial Setup
The pip installation has problems with new python (like 3.13)
Tested on python 3.8.5.

1. Install python 3.8.5
2. Setup the virtual environment by navigating to the PokeMii directory and running ```py -V:3.8 -m venv venv```
3. ```.\venv\Scripts\activate```
4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And you're all set! Run the game using ```python mainMenu.py``` (while the virtal environment is active of course!)
